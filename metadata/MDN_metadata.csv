Concentration and deposition data are reported unless the QR Code is C. D dry sample The RG measured a 0 precipitation amount net, or if the RG is missing, the BC < 1.5 mL . No concentration data are reported and are indicated by a -9.00. RGPPT, SUBPPT, and HGDEP are set to zero. T trace sample, used when the rain gage detects that an unmeasurable amount of precipitation occurred. No Hg concentration or depositions are shown. SUBPPT is set to 0.127 mm -- unknown sample type. Precipitation amount is unknown.",
