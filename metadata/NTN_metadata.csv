svol," Volume of sample captured in the sample bucket, in ml.",mL
ppt," Precipitation amount as measured by the recording rain gage, in
mm. Trace amounts are indicated by -7.",mm
subppt,"Precipitation amount used by NADP in calculating weighted-mean
concentrations, depositions and precipitation totals, in mm. In
most cases sub_ppt equals the recording raingage reading. Where
the raingage reading is missing or invalid, the equivalent depth of
the sample volume is used (for this conversion, the area of the
sample bucket is 678.9 square centimeters)",mm
valCode,"A code which indicates whether a sample is considered valid
according to NADP/NTN data validation rules. In the case of a
valid sample, the code indicates how the sample is used in
calculations of weighted-mean concentrations, depositions and
data completeness estimates.
0 - invalid sample
t - valid trace sample
d - valid dry collection period
w - valid sample of lab type w
wa - valid sample of lab type wa
wi - valid sample of lab type wi
Only samples with valcodes of w, wa and wi are used by
NADP/NTN in calculating weighted-mean concentrations and
depositions.",
inValCode,"A series of codes assigned to samples which are considered invalid
by NADP/NTN for the purposes of computing weighted-mean
concentrations, depositions and data completeness estimates.
The codes indicate the reasons for invalidation.
b - bulk sample (Collector was open continuously.)
u - undefined sample (Collector was open for > 6 hours and
less than the entire sampling interval when no precipitation
was occurring.)
f - field protocol departure
c - contaminated sample
v - inadequate volume for analysis
e - extended sampling interval (> 8 days)
l - lab error
i - incomplete chemical analyses
n - no sample collected
p - precipitation amount unknown
x - reasons other than described above",
